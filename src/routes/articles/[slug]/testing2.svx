# Svex up your markdown

## Good stuff in your markdown

Markdown is pretty good but sometimes you just need more.

Sometimes you need a boinger like this:

Not many people have a boinger right in their markdown.

## Markdown in your markdown

Sometimes what you wrote last week is so good that you just *have* to include it again.

I'm not gonna stand in the way of your egomania.

Yeah, thats right you can put wigdets in markdown (`.svx` files or otherwise). You can put markdown in widgets
too.


Sometimes you need your widgets **inlined** (like this:1) because why shouldn't you.
Obviously you have access to values defined in YAML (namespaced under `metadata`) and anything defined in an
fenced
`js exec` block can be referenced directly.

Normal markdown stuff works too:

| like | this |
|-------|------|
| table | here |

And *this* and **THIS**. And other stuff. You can also use all your favorite Svelte features, like `each`
blocks:

<ul>
    {#each [1, 2, 3, 4, "boo"] as item}
        <li>{item}</li>
    {/each}
</ul>

and all the other good Svelte stuff.
